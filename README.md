# AstroCloud GP Documentation

The purpose of this documentation is to provide insight into the AstroCloud GP project, including its features, demos, and architecture, without exposing the actual codebase as it is closed source, in hopes of growing into a commercial product in the future.

## Overview

Welcome to Egyptâ€™s First Managed Cloud Hosting Platform!

AstroCloud is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) developed as a graduation project aimed at empowering developers, startups, and businesses in Egypt with a fully managed cloud hosting solution.

AstroCloud simplifies application deployment and infrastructure management by supporting static and dynamic site hosting through GitHub integration or ZIP file uploads. It features an intuitive dashboard for managing deployments, along with continuous deployment, automated builds, and real-time log streaming.
